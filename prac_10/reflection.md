Practical Task Estimates
My accuracy in estimating time for tasks improved over the course. Initially, I underestimated the complexity, but with experience, my predictions became more realistic.

Learning from Code Reviews
From code reviews, I learned better coding practices and attention to detail. Reviewing others' code also broadened my understanding of different coding approaches.

Changes to Practical Tasks
If in charge, I'd include more real-world problem-solving tasks and encourage peer-programming to enhance practical learning
